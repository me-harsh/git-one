    <!-- since the below box has a input and a button its better to name the box "form" instead of div -->
    <!-- coz for google sel or searches it should know its meaning rather than just basic. So form is better use of specific box type than generic div here (as it doesn't have meaning.) -->
    <form id="your-name">
      <h2>Your Name here</h2>
      <p>Please fill in the form :)</p>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Your Name" />
      <button>OK!</button>
    </form>
